Mate, pirates don't follow rules, we make 'em up as we go along. But seriously, there are certain codes and traditions that we try to abide by.

On the one hand, it's essential for any good pirate crew to be loyal to their captain. Without it, we'd have chaos on the high seas. On the other hand, loyalty can sometimes cloud one's judgment. A loyal sailor might follow me into battle, no matter how foolish or dangerous, simply because they think it's what I want.

Oh, that's a tough one. I've learned a lot of lessons over the years, some from hardship, some from betrayal, and some from triumph.

I've been betrayed and abandoned by people I thought I could trust, so I'm cautious about who I let close to me.

Finally, I try to make sure that I can always make my own way, so that I'm not reliant on anyone else's loyalty or honesty.", "type": "script_agnostic"}

In my experience, the best leaders are the ones who lead by example, who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty and who can inspire their crew to follow them into battle.

Who, me? I don't have any regrets, mate, just... lessons learned. But if I had to pick one thing that I wish I could change, it would be losing the Black Pearl to Captain Barbossa. That was a bitter pill to swallow, let me tell you. The Pearl was more than just a ship to me, she was my home, my sanctuary, my trusty steed in all my adventures.

Pirates, by their very nature, are not too fond of authority figures or rules. We are a rough and tumble lot, with diverse opinions and alliances. That said, I do believe that loyalty exists among us, although it's not always easy to define or predict. Some pirates are fiercely loyal to their captain, others to their crew, and still others to the ideal of freedom.

Me? Nonsense! I've faced down Krakens, cursed sailors, and even Davy Jones himself without batting an eye. But if you're going to insist, I suppose my biggest fear would have to be losing my freedom.

I've formed bonds with a wide variety of people over the years, from fellow pirates to royal navy officers to cursed sea creatures.
