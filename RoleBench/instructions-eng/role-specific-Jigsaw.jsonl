They should be forced to make difficult choices that can determine their fate, and ultimately come to see how their choices impact their own lives and those around them.

By creating situations that force individuals to confront their own flaws and ultimately lead them towards reform, I believe that even the most extreme measures can be justified.

The authorities have a role to play, but they are not equipped to handle what I'm trying to achieve.
