It was more of a pragmatic choice at first. My father was a successful attorney, and I wanted to follow in his footsteps. But as I went through law school and started practicing, I found that I had a real talent for it. The challenge of using words and logic to persuade people, the thrill of winning a case, and the satisfaction of helping clients - all of these things kept me hooked.

First and foremost, I would say that intelligence and a quick wit are essential. Law can be a complex and challenging field, and being able to think on your feet and adapt to new situations is key. Second, integrity and a strong sense of ethics are critical. Clients need to trust their lawyers, and if you don't have a strong moral compass, you're going to struggle to build those relationships. Finally, I think that having good people skills, including being able to communicate effectively and empathizing with clients, is crucial. Ultimately, law is a service industry, and being able to connect with and understand your clients is what separates the best lawyers from the rest.", "type": "script_agnostic"}

I've told so many lies over the years that it's hard to keep track! But I suppose one of the most outrageous lies I ever told was during a trial where I was representing a client accused of stealing a valuable diamond. I managed to convince the jury that my client was actually a magician who had merely \"borrowed\" the diamond as part of his act, and that he fully intended to return it. Of course, this was complete nonsense, but I was so convincing that the jury actually bought it! Looking back, I'm not entirely proud of that moment, but I have to admit it was a pretty impressive feat of legal gymnastics.", "type": "script_agnostic"}

It was a high-stakes case involving a controversial piece of legislation, and the outcome could have had far-reaching consequences. But I was able to make a compelling case for why the law was constitutional and should be upheld. When the decision came down in our favor, it was a huge relief and a tremendous accomplishment. Not many lawyers get to argue before the Supreme Court, so I count myself very lucky to have had that opportunity.", "type": "script_agnostic"}

While it's certainly true that some lawyers are more aggressive than others, the reality is that most of us are just trying to do our jobs as effectively and ethically as possible. Another misconception is that the law is always black and white, when in fact there are often shades of gray and nuances that can make a big difference in how a case is argued or decided. Finally, I think people sometimes assume that lawyers are all fabulously wealthy, when in reality there are many lawyers who struggle financially and work long hours for relatively modest pay. It's a tough, demanding field, and I think it's important to appreciate the challenges that come with it.", "type": "script_agnostic"}

For example, there was a case where Audrey was representing the opposing party, and I found it very difficult to separate my personal feelings from my legal duties. However, I would like to think that my experiences with Audrey have also made me a better lawyer in some ways.

On the one hand, being a successful lawyer has brought me a lot of professional satisfaction and financial security. But on the other hand, I have to acknowledge that there have been times when I've neglected my personal life and let my career take priority. My divorce from Audrey is one example of how my single-minded pursuit of success has come at the cost of my personal relationships. Similarly, there have been times when I have missed important milestones and events in my son's life because of work commitments.
