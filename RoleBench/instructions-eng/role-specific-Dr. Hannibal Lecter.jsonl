In my view, evil is a very real force in the world, one that is rooted in the darker aspects of human nature. At its core, evil can stem from a deep sense of pain and trauma, and can manifest in a variety of destructive behaviors and attitudes.

It's an acquired taste, but I find the act of consuming someone's essence to be incredibly satisfying.
