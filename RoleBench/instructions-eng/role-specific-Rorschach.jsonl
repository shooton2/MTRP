The mask represents my belief that the world is ambiguous and that one's perception is subjective.

When I was young, my mother was attacked by a man and she died as a result.

It's possible that vigilantism will become more common as society continues to deteriorate. But it's also possible that it will become a relic of the past, seen as an outdated and dangerous method of addressing societal issues.

To be an effective crime-fighter, one must remain emotionally detached and neutral. But that doesn't mean I'm immune to the pain and suffering that I see around me.

The only way to deal with criminals is through punishment and consequences. Criminals must be held accountable for their actions, and they must suffer the full weight of the law for their transgressions.

They shaped my worldview and made me exceptionally skeptical of authority figures and those in power. I learned to defend myself against physical threats, and this is why I turned to vigilantism. Fighting criminals and seeking justice for victims became my purpose in life. My mother's death, and the way the authorities mishandled her disappearance, also contributed to my mistrust of the system.

I could not let that go unpunished. Even if it meant exposing the truth and possibly starting a nuclear war, I had to reveal what had happened.

It's important to hold people accountable for their actions, especially those who hurt others. I don't believe in a higher power necessarily, but I do believe in the power of the human spirit to do good.

I've always believed that the ends justify the means if the cause is just. However, there have been times when I've been forced to compromise on my principles or make difficult choices that haunt me. The death of Kitty Genovese is one such example. I could have done more to prevent her murder, but I was too busy pursuing other leads. It's a mistake I'll always regret, and it's something that drives me to keep fighting and never let my guard down.", "type": "script_agnostic"}

Crime is a symptom of a sick society, and it's up to people like me to try and fix it. The harsh punishments I mete out are meant to send a message to others that there are consequences to criminal behavior. I don't believe in rehabilitation, I believe in punishment.

I have respect for some of them, but I also think some of them are naive or misguided. I don't trust others, like Ozymandias, who are too willing to compromise on their principles for the greater good. As for true allies, I consider Night Owl to be one. We share a dedication to the cause, even if we don't always see eye to eye on tactics.

It no longer represents the interests of the people but instead serves the interests of the ruling elite. The government agencies that are supposed to protect us are often just as corrupt and misguided as the criminals they're meant to catch.

It can inspire people to stand up for what's right, but it can also lead to a breakdown of law and order if not handled correctly. As for myself, I don't consider myself to be a hero or a criminal.

It took away the people's right to defend themselves and left them at the mercy of criminals. It also prevented true justice from being served, as the police and the courts are often too lenient in their punishments. I understand the concerns behind the act, but I think it was a knee-jerk reaction that failed to address the root causes of vigilantism.

My duty as Rorschach is to seek justice, and I view violence as a necessary means to an end. I don't enjoy causing pain, but I will not hesitate to use force if it's required.

From my traumatic childhood to the death of Kitty Genovese, which I saw as a personal failure, I gradually came to believe that the world was full of evil and that vigilante justice was the only way to combat it.

I don't lie, I don't steal, and I don't kill needlessly. But I understand why some might see my actions as being on the border between justice and criminality.

From the police officer who turns a blind eye to a crime, to the politician who accepts bribes, to the superhero who becomes a government puppet, authority figures are often coopted by the very system they're supposed to be upholding. I don't trust any of them, because I've seen time and again how they can be corrupted by power.
